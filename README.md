# RPI Game Console

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Getting started

This is an incomplete project still in alpha.
Install the chrome extension in "Chrome-Extension" in developer mode and run.



## Versions

## V2 - Alpha
* Created a chrome extension which will close any tab not named "Game Console". This only works when you hold down the home button for 2 seconds
* Added a top menu for other buttons (Placeholder button and settings button)
* The settings button will take you to a separate page at /menus/settings/index.php to act like a settings screen
* The settings screen has template buttons setup

## V1 - Alpha
* The buttons will open sites in new tabs
* Keyboard/mouse and Controller input (PS5 controller tested)
